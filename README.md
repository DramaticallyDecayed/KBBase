# KBBase
The branch contains entities used for describing environment. In comparison with first-approximation brach another type of entity representation is chosen - chain axioms and dynamic "subclassing". The concepts of associative relations (direct and inderect) and generative relations (direct, composite, system) are implemented.
The model do not support situation formation.
